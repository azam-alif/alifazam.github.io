	<p>Vim the most used text editor of the world. You can like it, dislike it, but can never ignore it. Most of the tech guys love vim. So, should you. </p>
	<p>Vim is already installed in your system if you are using Linux. Just type vim, then hit enter. <b>Congratulations</b> you are inside vim. The fist thing anybody want to know, about vim is, "how can I exit from this?" </p>
	<p>To exit from vim you need to type <b>esc, :, q</b>. Now, you are outside of vim and HAPPY. </p>
	<p>Vim has an awesome learning documentation, called "vimtutor". You just need to type <b>vimtutor</b> in the terminal and hit enter. Now, you are in the vim learning official documentation. You can learn everything about vim from here.</p>
	<p>Just remember one thing, if you complete whole vimtutor in first time opening, then that's best. But if you need to go somewhere in the middle, just remember, that you don't need to scroll down the whole page just to go where you were.</p> 
	<p>So, when you are quitting vim tutor, press <b>ctrl+G</b>, this will show your working directory along with the line number you are into. Remember that. So, next time when you are again in vimtutor, you will see that you are in the starting of the file. Now all you need to do is type <b>line_number</b> then <b>gg</b>. Suppose, you were in line 250, then the command will be <b>250gg</b>. You will also learn about this inside the vimtutor session. </p>
	<p>That's it. Happy VIM journey.</p>
